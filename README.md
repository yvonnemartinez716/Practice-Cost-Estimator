# Practice Cost Estimator
Medicare Cost Report contains thousands of data elements per report for several thousand Hospital providers. This makes it difficult for users of the data to sift through without investing a significant amount of time.  This app would focuses on the cost per procedure. I will do this by looking at the Physicians Fee Schedule (PFS) and the Medicare conversion factor to estimate procedure costs.

## Background

Medicare payment has been made under the PFS for the services of physicians and other billing professionals since 1992.  Physicians’ services paid under the PFS are furnished in a various settings. For most services furnished in a physician’s office, Medicare makes payment to physicians and other professionals at a single rate based on the full range of resources involved in furnishing the service. In contrast, PFS rates paid to physicians and other billing practitioners in facility settings, such as a hospital outpatient department (HOPD) or an ASC, reflect only the portion of the resources typically incurred by the practitioner in the course of furnishing the service.

For many diagnostic tests and a limited number of other services under the PFS, separate payment may be made for the professional and technical components of services. The technical component is frequently billed by suppliers, like independent diagnostic testing facilities and radiation treatment centers, while the professional component is billed by the physician or practitioner.

Payments are based on the relative resources typically used to furnish the service. Relative value units (RVUs) are applied to each service for work, practice expense, and malpractice expense. These RVUs become payment rates through the application of a fixed-dollar conversion factor. Geographic adjustments (geographic practice cost index) are also applied to the total RVUs to account for variation in practice costs by geographic area. Payment rates are calculated to include an overall payment update specified by statute.
